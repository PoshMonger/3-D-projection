# 3D-projection
HTML canvas element and custom vertice constructor functions to plot 3 dimensional projections

-Tracking verticies based on center of cube, which side it is on, and initial length of side.

- Differentiating between 2d and 3d mapped verticies

-Using project() based on distance of cube and rotate() based rotation matrix coefficients to re plot vertices based on rotation

-Nested for loops to plot vertices per face, faces per cube, cubes per amount of objects

-EventListeners added to DOM are on really suited for more than one object at the moment

How to interact:

-SCROLL IN AND OUT to add or remove distance between camera and cube

-CLICK AND DRAG to rotate the cube about its center
